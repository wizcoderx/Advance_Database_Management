# What is OLAP and OLTP?
<hr>

## OLAP stands for Online Analytical Processing, and OLTP stands for Online Transaction Processing.

<hr>

<p>In Data Science of Advanced Database Management Systems (ADBMS), OLAP and OLTP are two types of data processing systems.</p>
<p>When it comes to using data to make smarter decisions, it's not a question of choosing between OLAP and OLTP.
It's a question of how to make the best use of both processing for your situation.</p>
<br>
<b>Now let's talk about OLAP (Online Analytical Processing):</b><br>

<ul>
<li>OLAP uses data to gain valuable information.</li>
<li>It's a system for performing multi-dimensional analysis at high speeds on large volumes of data; the large volumes of data could be the data warehouse, data mart, or other centralized data store.</li>
<li>The core of most OLAP databases is the OLAP cube.</li>
<li>OLAP cubes are multidimensional. They allow users to view data from different perspectives at once. Also, users can quickly query, report on, and analyze this multi-dimensional data.</li>
<li>Here, dimensions mean simply an element of a particular data set. For example, sales figures might have several dimensions related to region, time of year, and product models.</li>
<li>The OLAP cube extends the row-by-column format of a traditional relational database schema and adds layers for other data dimensions.</li>
<li>Example: While the top layer of the cube might organize sales by region, data analysts can also drill down into layers for sales by State or City or Specific store.</li>
<br>
<b>Uses</b>

<li>OLAP is ideal for tasks such as data mining, business intelligence, and complex analytical calculations.</li>
<li>Also well-suited for business reporting functions like financial analysis, budgeting, sales forecasting, etc.</li>

</ul>

<b>Now let's talk about OLTP (Online Transaction Processing):</b><br>

<ul>
<li>OLTP is used for real-time execution of a large number of database transactions by a large number of people.</li>
<li>OLTP uses non-relational databases.</li>
<li>It can process a large number of relatively simple transactions, for doing things like insertion, update, delete of data, to do this with rapid processing with response time measured in milliseconds.</li>
<li>They also enable multi-user access to the server data while ensuring data integrity and provide indexed data sets for Rapid searching.</li>
<br>
<b>Uses</b>
<li>OLTP systems are behind everyday transactions from ATMs, Hotel Reservations, in-store purchases.</li>
<li>OLTP can also be used for non-financial transactions, like changing passwords and text messages, which also come under OLTP.</li>
<br>

<p> So basically, OLTP does all the infrastructure work and OLAP does all the analytical work.</p>

## Difference between OLAP and OLTP

| Feature                                   | OLAP                                        | OLTP                                                |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Optimization Focus**                    | Complex data analysis                      | Processing a massive number of transactions          |
| **User Type**                             | Data scientists, knowledge workers, etc.    | Front-line workers (cashiers, bank tellers, hotel desk, etc.) for customer service applications|

<b>FACT:</b>
<p>OLAP systems may be used to analyze data that leads to business process improvements in OLTP systems, and most organizations do that.</p>
