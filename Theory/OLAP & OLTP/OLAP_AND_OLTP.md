<p>In Data Science of Advance database management Systems (ADBMS) OLAP and OLTP are two types of data processing systmes </p>
<p>When i comes to using data to make smarter decisions its not a question of choosing between OLAP and OLTP
Its a question of how to make the best use of both processing, for you situatuon</p>
<br>
<b>Now lets talk about OLAP (Online Analytical Processing):<br>

<ul>
<li>The OLAP uses data to gain valuable information.</li>
<li>Its a system for performing multi-dimensional analysis at high speeds on large volumnes of data, the large volumnes of data could be the data warehouse, data mart, or other centralized data store</li>
<li>The core of most of OLAP databases is OLAP cube.</li>
<li>OLAP cubes are multidimensional. They allow users to view data from different perspectives at once. Also users can quickly query, report on and analyze this multi-dimensional data</li>
<li>Here dimensions means simply an element of a particular data set, Example: Sales figure might have several dimensions related to region, time of year, and product models.</li>
<li>The OLAP cube extends the row by column format of a traditional relational database schema and adds layers for other data dimensions</li>
<li>Example: While the top layer of the cube might organize sales by region, data analyst can also drill down into layers for sales by State or City or Specicifc store.</li>
<b>Uses<b>
<li>OLAP is ideal for tasks such as datamining, business intelligence, and complex analytical calculations</li>
<li>Also well suited for business reporting functions like financial analysis, bugeting, sales forcasting, etc</li>

</ul>
